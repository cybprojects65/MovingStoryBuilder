AUSTRIA,VC_01_AT,ALMO alp oxen,"ALMO is an alp oxen farmers association with about 500 members. The registered brand is owned by the farmers association. ALMO is the lead high quality product of the LEADER-region „Almenland & Energieregion Weiz-Gleisdorf“, and well embedded into the regional development. ALMO is based on traditional pasture framing, and characterised  by exceptionally high animal welfare standards (cooperation with an Austrian animal welfare NGO). Through the cooperation between farmers and with other value chain actors (veterinaries, butchers, retailers, tourism, regional development agency) several innovations emerged. ","Predicted changes in climate (extrem weather conditions: drough, heavy rain) are likely to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture‐based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth.
Many of the ALMO producers are small scale, women led farms. They are economically very vulnerable, if the stable price arrangements can not be kept up, their income security is at risk.
",Current & Predicted,Traditional & Innovative,Endogenous & Exogenous,"Many innovations, especially their implementation, were/are based on social relations and engage various actors within the VC. Drivers for innovations have always been members of the initiative and the network it is embedded in: due to its embeddedness into the broader regional development initiatives, ALMO key persons work together with others in local action groups, which have been set up within LEADER for different projects. This leads to a cross-sectoral exchange of ideas and insights into various fields of broader regional development concept. Most innovations resulted from different actors bringing in different knowledge and different expertise. E.g. specific feeding practices (in order to achieve a very high meat quality) have been developed by the farmers in cooperation with one of the business partners, and a consultant (innovation based practice and academic knowledge). Another example is the building of stables: one of the farmers, who had to build a new free-range stable, had seen such stables somewhere else, and developed an adaptation of this type for the Almenland region. Many of the other farmers rebuilt their stables according to his model (‘System Haberl’).",New processes & New marketing strategies,"The initiative is driven by special relationships of the initiators with other value chain actors, well embedded into the regional development, tourism and local culture.

AUSTRIA,VC_03_AT,Almenland Herbs,"12 herb farmers from the Almenland Nature Park founded an association in order to jointly process and sell various products made from herbs under The ""Almenland Kräuter"" brand. The herbs are grown in small-scale organic cultivation or collected in the wild nature. All are harvested by hand. They offer a large variety of different herbs and a wide range of products ranging from food and drinks to cosmetic and wellness products.","Extreme weather conditions as a result of climate change do not only change the natural vegetation, but also cultivation practices.

The initiative is well embedded in the regional development strategy of Almenland ""Genussregion” (“region of culinary delight“: promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). Some of the educational programmes are carried out in cooperation with the nature park and imply activities raising awareness for the natural habitat in the area and health related aspects; activities also enrich the touristic programme.
Moreover, from an ecological perspective, the cultivation of herbs helps improve the quality of near-natural areas by enabling more diverse agricultural production with less use of pesticides. Flowering plants in particular provide insects with nectar and pollen at different times of the year and thus have the potential to reduce habitat fragmentation. 
Preserving areas suitable for wild collection and carefully collecting herbs is a suitable way of preserving the diversity of permanent grasslands without changing the type of land use. On the one hand, this represents an increased food supply for insects and, on the other hand, it offers additional income for the local farmers.","The association links 12 farms, which are certified organic. Some of the processing is done individually, other within the cooperation. The products are mainly sold locally via small shops, through a joint shop, online, and through hotels.

AUSTRIA,VC_05_AT,Almenland Honey,"A group of innovative beekeepers (4 farms - ca. 1.200m) from the Almenland region has set itself the goal of not only producing alpine honey of special quality, but also a variety of other high quality products, such as  chocolates, mead, and various products with propolis, wax. Numerous awards confirm their quality work. Morover they offer educational programmes and beekeeping seminars, and they have set up cooperations with medical experts for apitherapy.","Beekeepers and their bees are very closely linked to local weather conditions, thus highly sensitive to climate change issues.
Especially in winter, fluctuating temperatures disturb the hibernation of the bees. As soon as the thermometer rises above 10 ° C, the first bees fly off, but usually cannot find any flowers. If they even keep brood due to longer warm periods in the winter months, this weakens the colonies even more, because they can only generate the necessary brood nest temperature of approx. 35 ° C by consuming their food supplies. As soon as it gets cold again, the temperature fluctuations demand enormous heating power. That costs the people unnecessary energy.
In mild winters, the bees also breed all year round. This favors the development and multiplication of the Varroa mite, because it then also multiplies in the brood cells together with the bee brood in winter. Several, ever-growing generations of Varroa mites can also arise in this way. Most beekeepers do not take notice of this situation in spring because their bee colonies multiply rapidly during this time. The rude awakening follows after the summer solstice. From this point on, the bees reduce their colony size in order to get through the winter as a smaller colony. The varroa multiplication, which takes place up to the summer solstice, then kills bee colonies in summer.
There have also been indications for years that a change in temperature in spring disrupts the fine coordination between the pollinator insects and the plants to be pollinated. ",Current & Predicted,Traditional & Innovative,Endogenous & Exogenous,"specific quality: In the Almenland Nature Park there are almost no intensively cultivated fields and fruit crops, thus no pesticides are used. Therefore, no spray residues can get into the honey. In addition, the wide range of different herbs and medicinal plants, offers the bees the opportunity to produce honey with special active ingredients.
Medical applications of bee products: cooperation with well-known apitherapy experts, who use bees' products in their practice (honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, beeswax and bee venom). Engagement in apitherapy professional events. Certified bee mental training offered.

This is a thread in the context of climate change. About a decade ago, the number of char in the lakes declined drastically. This was due to the introduction of river perch and their rapid reproduction, as well as an overstocking of pike. Various methods were used to restore the balance of the lakes.

The fish is marketed as fresh fish (put on ice) or smoked fish directly to the regional gastronomy and to consumers.

Especially in the management of the lakes, the issue of sustainability plays an essential role. The demand for domestic wild-caught fish far exceeds the supply.

This has been a major driving force for the long-term abandonment of grasslands with scrub encroachment leading to a loss of valuable habitats, especially in more inaccessible areas.  At the same time this puts increasing pressure upon those grasslands which are most accessible.  ",Current,Traditional,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Grassland,Natural,"There are around 30,700 ha of Utilised Agricultural Area (UAA) in the Western Stara Planina – of which the majority (65%) is pastures and meadows (72% are common grasslands) plus 20% mixed land use associated with the small farms and 15% arable land at lower altitude.  Agriculture is traditionally low input and extensive.  Together with the low population density and mountain relief this means that the majority of farmland is considered as High Nature Value.  This ranges from mosaics of low intensive arable plots and orchards at lower altitude to the alpine grasslands at high altitude with semi-natural meadows and pastures at medium altitude.  The low intensity grazing and mowing of these grasslands creates habitats for valuable plant and animal species.  The biodiversity richness of these agricultural landscapes is recognised with a total of seven Natura 2000 sites (5 SPAs and 2 pSCI) including significant areas of farmland.","National policies, especially the implementation of the EU-funded rural development policy, has great potential to reverse the loss of public goods due to the abandonment of the HNV grasslands in the region.  For example, HNV grasslands have been eligible for agri-environmental payments under the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 Bulgarian Rural Development Programmes.  However, they continue to decline in area and greater attention needs to be given to a more integrated approach that addresses the profitability and overall socio-economic viability of the traditional pastoral systems in the region.

","One of the main challenges for viticulture in the municipalities of Morgex et la Salle are the extremely high altitude for vines (above 1200 m), which creates constant risk of frost all over the growing season which in one night take away the hall harvest in one night. Another important problem to be overcome, particularly for mountain winegrowing, is that of increasing the surface under vineyards in order to be more present on the market.

Many native grape varieties, as part of the Valdostan culture, have recently been selected and replanted. The Prié Blanc, the only native white-berried variety, is one of the rare varieties not grafted onto American vines thanks to special climate conditions that have preserved them from phylloxera. Versatility of this variety allows to produce high quality wines of different types: sparkling wine, dry still wine and sweet dessert wine made from late harvest grapes.
The vines are grown on terraces supported by dry stone walls, on embankments or, where possible, in the direction of the slope. Given the features of the terrain and the low rainfall in the area, it is not necessary to take any particular measures to channel and control surface water.
","Key activities of the VC are vine growing and wine production. The vineyard of Aosta Valley consists of just under 23,5 ha of which more than 18 ha belong to the members of the cooperative ""Cave Mont Blanc"", and other 5,5 ha belong to 3 individual wine producers. A peculiarity of local viticulture is the great fragmentation of the cultivated area in small plots of land. Individual wine producers, grape producers, who sell grapes to cooperatives, and the cooperative winery are the key actors of this small value chain. In the last thirty years the wines of Valle d'Aosta have had a remarkable growth in quality, witnessed by the numerous awards at national and international level both in oenological competitions and by guides and magazines.

NMK,VC_17_NMK,Oriental tobacco  ,"  Republic of Macedonia is distinguished by tobacco production which consists only of oriental types. In Macedonia there were also big oscillations in tobacco production, depending on the state policy. In fact, this production was going to collapse, but with the subsiding policy of the state it has been reestablished, with good opportunities even to increase. This is especially important because there is no alternative crop that would absorb so much labor force and would have such an economic impact as tobacco.

Beneficiaries of the programme include both individual beekeepers and beekeeping organisations.  Available support includes specialist consultancy services; promotion of bee products; training courses; investment support for production and processing facilities (including direct support for transhumance of hives); subsidised medicinal products for varroasis; national level management of transhumance / pastoral beekeeping (especially important in the mountain areas); financial assistance for restocking (purchase of queens and bee families), and; analytical services for testing quality of honey.


","The sector has great potential to grow both in terms of production capacity and consumer demand, but there is inevitably growing concern about the on-going threat of disease, invasive species and loss of habitats / feeding sources due both to the intensification of arable cropping (including poor management of insecticides) and the abandonment of grasslands, especially in the mountain areas.

Each potter has his/her own method of shaping the clay using traditional tools: a potter’s wheel and comb for shaping, a hollowed-out bull’s horn and a fine wire-tipped stick for decoration, and a wood-burning stove for firing. Women then decorate the fired pots using specific techniques and tools to draw traditional motifs.

ROMANIA,VC_19_RO,ALL SEASON MOUNTAIN TOURISM,Mountain tourism in the Carpathians is typically all-season with similar visitor numbers in both winter and summer.  There is a wide variety of accomodation available (both catered and self-catering) and an increasingly diverse range of leisure pursuits available.  Bran commune in Braşov county has been one of several 'hotspots' for mountain tourism in Romania for many years and it remains typical of the low- to mid-range tourism experience offered in many regions catering primarily for the Romanian market with some international visitors.,"The Bran area offers a significant number of attractions for tourists, but the pattern of development during the last 30 years has come to threaten its future viability and sustainability as an attractive and profitable tourist destination.  Bran is very well located and easily accessible with relatively good infrastructure.  It has developed as a multi-purpose recreational resource with some relatively good accomodation / restaurants combined with a proliferation of rustic-styled ""agro-touristic"" farms and second homes (the majority of which are newly constructed).  Consequently the traditional rural identity of the area has become lost to an 'urban-type' over-development which increasingly discourages foriegn visitors whilst still appealing to the domestic visitor.

owner taking over the land, and often involves external expert consultants to undertake the monitoring and advise on ecological measures. Some of the measures require 
contractors (e.g. large machinery to plant trees) which are not available locally. However, these estates prioritise involving local volunteers and training local people in conservation jobs.

timber and meat (there is some timber/lamb production) and increase the production of public goods (regulating and cultural ecosystem services). The future
success of the rewilding will depend on local as well as national support and acceptance of this switch. It is unclear from desktop research how much cultural (local)
knowledge is involved, with many partners in the rewilding effort coming from elsewhere in the UK or even internationally.","Key activities: tree planting, habitat restoration, monitoring flora and fauna; key actors - land owners (NGOs or wealthy philanthropists); consultants; students/academics and volunteers;  inputs include seedlings for tree planting, materials for gully blocking, path and fencing, scientific monitoring equipment, lots of marketing (websites, social media). ; outputs - increased habitat quality, increased flora and fauna populations, increased skills and understanding, piloting new natural capital monitoring tools (that may lead to a quality scheme).

There are diferent sectors competing , from energy through small hydro power plants, which present huge threat to mountain ecosystems and right to water. Use of mountain streams for fish production is linked to clear and not poluted waters and springs. The environmental impacts need to be monitored and considered due to challenges in water supply over summer months, possible pressures in releasing organic waste or intensive fish breeding.

Some specific challenges are the followings: new materials that compete with cork (plastic lids, synthetic porous materials, wax); reduced number of employees and lack of capacity building for the workers; plant diseases that attack the cork trees and hamper the cork production (e.x., Phytophthora); integrating the transformation process of the raw material in the region; stationallity of the harvest and the need to use mules for the work due to the land characteristics (accesibility and slope).

After another 9 years, a new layer will be grown and called ""secundero o refugo"", and finally 9 years later, the first cork can be harvested. The cork oak trees play an important role in the regional sustainability as they capture CO2, maintain the soils from the erosion and desertification and host great biodiversity. The harvest technique is ancient and the knowledge is transmited through generations. The loss of generational replacement is causing a loss of knowledge, especially in cork extraction techniques, which puts the sustainability of the value chain at risk.","Harvesting requiers a traditional genrational knowledge.

The wool is washed in the German part of Switzerland, then carded in the Jura and sold at the regional wool centre. The wool is spun, dyed, felted and transformed into various creations. In addition, educational activities are organised.","A part of the VC is not present in the MLR, since the wool is washed on the germand part of Switzerland.

In addition, it is observed that the producers make direct sales to consumers and hotels. However, direct sales are not at a high level. One of the most important problems in the value chain is the marketing of high quality products at low prices. The producers are trying to avoid this problem by selling directly.

In Antalya, the district with the highest annual total sunshine duration is Elmalı (https://gepa.enerji.gov.tr/MyCalculator/pages/7.aspx). In addition, the air is cool and dry because of high mountain region. Both the high annual sunshine duration and the favorable climatic conditions played an important role in the development of greenhouse cultivation in Elmalı. Especially greenhouse tomato cultivation is very common in the region. Due to the favorable conditions in the region, greenhouse tomato producers produce higher quality tomatoes compared to the producers located in the plain. Tomatoes produced in greenhouses in Elmalı have a better appeal than those grown in the plain.","There are three major challenges for growers growing tomatoes in greenhouse. These are respectively; low crop selling prices, crop diseases and labor shortages. Greenhouse tomato production is very common in Antalya. There are many greenhouse tomato growers especially in the plain region of Antalya. The high supply of tomatoes causes the prices to fall. Although greenhouse tomato growers in Elmalı produce higher quality tomatoes compared to the producers in the plain, they cannot obtain high prices. Producers encounter crop diseases.

The value chain has positive effects on the environment. Agricultural wastes (wheat stalk, chicken manure, cotton pulp, etc.) are used in compost production. These wastes are transformed into a product with high economic and nutritional value. The fact that the climate of the region is suitable for mushroom cultivation reduces the costs of climatization. The region is close to raw material sources for mushroom cultivation. This reduces logistics costs.
