It defends farmers' interests regarding the evolution of european and national regulations. It provides specific training (hygiene; different processes for transformation of milk) and it has developped an efficient structure for cheeses' transport; in Corsica and in the French Continent. As on-farm cheese making often plays a key role in preserving traditional know-how; it is recognized in a geographical indication (PDO Brocciu) and plays a central role in the on-going labelling project (5 different projets regarding different types of local cheeses: venachese; sartinese; calinzanincu; niolincu; bastelicacciu). Of-farm cheese making is particularly present in mountainous areas where it is one of the remaining (agricultural) activities. It contributes to the villages' vividness. In its traditional form; this type of husbandry contributes to land management near those villages.

Key actors: mushroom compost or compost material suppliers; spawn suppliers; companies; small-scale farmers; traders; producer union; retailers; consumers Key activities: Input supply; growing; harvesting; processing; packaging; logistics; marketing; sales; purchasing It is stated that 96% of mushroom production in Korkuteli is carried out by small family farms. 94% of the mushrooms produced in the region are sold to traders. The rate of producers trained in mushroom production is 9.4% ( ahin; 2019). The value chain has positive effects on the environment. Agricultural wastes (wheat stalk; chicken manure; cotton pulp; etc.) are used in compost production. These wastes are transformed into a product with high economic and nutritional value. The fact that the climate of the region is suitable for mushroom cultivation reduces the costs of climatization. The region is close to raw material sources for mushroom cultivation. This reduces logistics costs. The short shelf life of the product is a major disadvantage for small family farms. Because most of the small family farms do not have the necessary infrastructure for the processing and distribution of the product.,437,bed; year; compost; portugal; north; value chain; logistics; tourism; vegetable oil; chicken manure; arable land; hungary; reference; mediterranean sea; number; mountain; population density; bey; antalya; slovakia; mushroom; 1980s; addition; social; switzerland; gross value added; climate; employment; community; demand; material; turkey; antalya province; per capita income,36.0,39.0

Title: Organic Olive Oil from Zuheros. Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is SPAIN ADEGUA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 ES. The organic production of olive oil in mountain areas represents a small group of producers and a niche market that can guarantee their survival as long as a specific market niche; sufficient public aid; and a process of training and internal leadership are consolidated. At the present time it gathers a small group of producers that generally must go to companies located outside the municipality to acquire inputs and to elaborate the olive oil; except for a small family oil mill that elaborates its own oil. Neither of them put their oils on the market except in a symbolic way. The local olive oil cooperative does not have an organic production chain; although it does certify its production under the BAENA Denomination of Origin brand. The main reason why this Denomination of Origin was created is the diversity of varieties existing in this municipality; which; however; is hardly valued commercially.

Actors of this VC are developping adaptation and transformation strategies for irrigated field crops in the face of climate change: Diversification strategies; Rationalization of irrigation; especially for high value crops and Crop rotation strategies. A renewed network of cooperation around water resource is also in development. Besides; due to climatic change; specific cultures from high and middle mountain areas tend to be developed in large fields in the down valley. It is thus interesting to study this phenomenon and its economic and ecological impact on the territory.,62,bed; alps; gardening; year; drôme; north; scarcity; value chain; parasitism; protection; soil; rhône; matter; reference; agriculture; number; mountain; east; population density; irrigation; carbon; livestock; west; france; park; cooperation; new balance; innovation; stockage; middle mountain; question; rotation; gross value added; employment; community; demand; water; food; system; management; crop rotation; per capita income; valley; river; asset; landscape; territory,2.0,47.0

Title: Wine and Tourism 1. Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is ITALY VINIDEA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 26 IT. Key activities of the VC are vine growing and wine production. The vineyard of Aosta Valley consists of just under 23;5 ha of which more than 18 ha belong to the members of the cooperative 'Cave Mont Blanc'; and other 5;5 ha belong to 3 individual wine producers. A peculiarity of local viticulture is the great fragmentation of the cultivated area in small plots of land. Individual wine producers; grape producers; who sell grapes to cooperatives; and the cooperative winery are the key actors of this small value chain. In the last thirty years the wines of Valle d'Aosta have had a remarkable growth in quality; witnessed by the numerous awards at national and international level both in oenological competitions and by guides and magazines. About 70% of the production is consumed locally; thanks to the presence of a flourishing tourist activity that brings more than three million visitors to Valle d'Aosta every year. A share between 10% and 20% is destined for sale in other Italian regions; while the remaining share is destined for export.

Title: Goat and sheep milk and dairy products. The milk comes from small scaled family farms grazing with natural grass. Dairy products are produced in an artisanal way. Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 TR. The number of farmers engaged in goat and sheep breeding in the region is 1179 and 1572; respectively. Since pasture areas are insufficient; goat and sheep breeders purchase feed from feed suppliers. However; high feed prices increase the cost of production. The most frequently used marketing channels for product sales are usually retailers; companies and traders from outside the region. In addition; it is observed that the producers make direct sales to consumers and hotels. However; direct sales are not at a high level. One of the most important problems in the value chain is the marketing of high quality products at low prices. The producers are trying to avoid this problem by selling directly. It is seen that the producers are members of the Sheep and Goat Breeders Association in Antalya. This union takes part in the implementation of animal breeding programs at the regional level to increase productivity.,435,bed; spain; year; value chain; vegetable oil; ice; tomato; sales; hungary; reference; mediterranean sea; number; mountain; population density; czech republic; bey; france; highland; antalya; serbia; agricultural cooperative; pasture; sheep; addition; innovation; social; switzerland; milk; greenhouse; cream; gross value added; goat; employment; demand; grassland; marketing; species; turkey; antalya province; plant; organization; per capita income; animal; farmer; time; austria,36.0,39.0

The wine produced in the area has 2 appellations: PDO 5terre (a white wine from local varieties Bosco; Albarola; Vermentino); and PDO 5terre schiacchetra (a dessert wine from the same grapes). From the 500 hectars of the 50'ies; the vineyard surface is now reduced at about 80 hectars; divided in small lots with an average surface of 2;500 square meters. The commercial production of wine has 4 actors; three family owned estates and a cooperative; this last producing 55% of the total volume of wine of the area. Most wine is sold through the HORECA channel (Hotel; Restaurants; Caterings) and usually has is totally absorbed by local clients. The limited volume of wine of the region do not require the introduction in other domestic or export markets. Nevertheless; the high cost of production and the ecosystem service provided to the landscape would require much higher selling prices; that the local community is not open to accept: therefore; instead of promoting the local wine together with other products of the territory; restaurants of the region tend to propose cheaper wines from other regions. The unsufficient income and the increase of average age of the grapegrowers make questionable the sustainability of this value chain. Several initiatives to mantain viticulture in the region did not succed for lack of adherents: i) land bank; with lots of agricultural land offered for free to new farmers; and ii) public contributions to land consolidation.

Although there are hundreds of ways to brew the local traditional beer; they all share a common feature; the smoky taste. The general process is as follows. First the grains are soaked and cleaned. Afterwards they are spread on a growing frame and they are moved by hand several times per day to keep the heat evenly distributed among the grains. Four days after; the grains are dried in the traditional Sainna (a fire drier with wooden planks with holes on top of which the grains are spread). Here is where the grains get the smoky flavour. Finally; after around eight days of hand work with the grains; they are ready to be brewed. Up to 22 beer breweries can be found in this municipality and also few malthouses. In addition; there is an annual beer festival where most of those hundreds of small brewers participate and the best Stjørdalsøl brewer is crowned.,294,heat; bed; year; taste; municipality; trondheim; number; population density; stjørdalselva; brewery; fire; e-commerce; tradition; day; beer; hand; knowledge; innovation; vinje; gross value added; employment; urbanization; smoked beer; water; malt; marketing; per capita income; river,14.76093611111111,64.77964194444445

Theses prodcuts are mostly driven to long supply chain distribution and export. Abricot des Baronnies (south of Drome) is currently in the process of obtention of an IGP. Stone fruits cultures are currently facing strong pressure due to climate change: more and more freezing episodes in the spring; water scarcity as well as invasion of disease and parasites. To adapt; various strategies are tested: fight against frost with heating technics; fight against disease with treatments; insect nets; diversification of produced variety and fruits. In parallel; an organic production of stone fruits is developping. They are facing the same challenges but using different cultural practices to saveguard biodiversity (introduction of nesting box; chickens in the orchyard) and seeking to diversifying (new fruit culture more adapted to climatic conditions).

Title: Fresh Vegetable (Greenhouse tomato): Greenhouse Tomato Cultivation in Highland. Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 02 TR. The most common marketing channel used by greenhouse tomato growers is the wholesale markets brokers. The traders are used moderately in product sales. The direct to consumer sales are low. The greenhouse tomato growers sell to exporter companies less frequently. Although tomatoes produced in the region are of high quality; producers cannot get high prices for their products. This is one of the negative aspects of the value chain. Also; the greenhouse tomato growers in Elmal do not have a farmer's organization. On the other hand; the fact that the tomato produced in Elmal is a highland product creates a positive effect in terms of the product's value chain.

Title: Dittany grows widely and is cultivated in Embaros; Dicti mountain area. Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is GREECE. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 13 GR. Dittany has been growing wildly on Crete s mountains inside fissures and calcareous cliffs since ancient times. It is depicted in frescos and myths as a healing herb. It is part of the cultural heritage of Greece and on Crete and it is tied to communal foraging- collecting practices; essential oil extraction and healing rituals depicting how the bio-diversity of the agricultural ecosystems can be brought in harmony with human praxis and be utilized for their benefit. Nowadays; the foraging practices are depicted in collectives in Crete; such as 'Apo Koinou' that harvest herbs such as dittany and bring them to market. Currently the use of Embaros dittany in liquors; cosmetics; insecticides; and pharmaceuticals depict how ancient cultural traditions are cycled into new industries; forms of production; commerce; and ultimately; how a value chain is re-constituted in the postmodern world. The Agricultural Coop of Emparos; Viannos Heraklion; is the major actor in this chain; but faces many challenges.

Title: MOUNTAIN MILK. Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is BULGARIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 08 BG. The profitability of dairy farms in the region depends greatly upon the price paid for the raw milk produced - which in turn depends upon the milk quality. The key quality indicators that farmers must achieve when supplying raw milk are: i) clean and unadulterated; ii) not containing veterinary substances e.g. antibiotics; iii) free of pathogenic microorganisms; and; iv) not containing colostrum (i.e. not sold until 7 days after calving). Achieving these basic standards - and thereby meeting the food safety and hygiene regulations - remains a challenge for many farmers in the Western Stara Planina and this impacts greatly upon their farm and household income. Common problems at farm level in the mountains are lack of well-trained and motivated staff; poor veterinary services and unguided use of veterinary medicines; low quality livestock and inadequate nutrition; lack of investment in modernisation of buildings and equipment; and; overall poor management. It is for these reasons that the Mountain Milk Association was formed in 2008 as a professional body to represent the interests of both farmers and dairies supplying raw milk in the challenging conditions of the Bulgarian mountain areas.,29,godech; bed; balkan mountains; year; bulgaria; municipality; reference; number; mountain; population density; cap; province; colostrum; hygiene; livestock; farm; rila; logo; raw milk; vitosha; legislation; innovation; sofia province; milk; investment; sofia; sredna gora; gross value added; employment; food; grassland; godech municipality; nutrition; management; per capita income; household; dairy,25.5,42.75

The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 20 SER. Livestock husbandry is the main agricultural activity in the area of Pester plateau. Beef meat production is at the basis of the VC; having cattle farms solely for beef meat; where farmers sell them as live animals to the middle man (usually at very low prices). There are about 33.000 cattle at Sjenica municipality; but this number is declining. Animals are grazed on natural pastures; with lot of specific wild herbs and plants; which leads to high quality of beef meat. As a part of the production systems; farmers produce Sjenica cheese which is protected as PDO product. Traditional meat products like Sjenica sudzuk (sausage) and dry beef meat are also in the process to become GI products. Farms are mostly owned by farmers and registered as agriculture households; and there are a couple of meat processing units (companies) and small dairies. Farm processing is traditional; and there is increasing trend in small house processing units registration (Serbia adopted regulative for small processing unit registration). They have to fulfil HACCP requirements. Products are sold at national market; with rising interest for their export. Processing companies usually also have Halal certification; aiming Muslim markets and customers. Regional rural development centre exists in the area; providing advisory support and services to farmers This VC is closely interconnected with VC of sheep breeding; sheep meat production and processing; together with producing sheep and mixed cheese (sheep and cow milk cheese).,292,beauty; year; albania; beef; population density; road; livestock; farm; halal; highland; serbia; border; waste; highland mountains; cattle; gross value added; karst; veal; system; middle east; uvac; turkey; dinaric alps; cross-border region; prosciutto; grazing; tourism; novi pazar; protection; summer; protected area; sjenica; hospitality; e-commerce; tradition; innovation; nature; cross; climate; employment; montenegro; sustainable tourism; people; food; grassland; marketing; management; infrastructure; meat; per capita income; landscape; governance,20.933333333333334,43.95

Title: Fresh Fruit (Grapes). Event: Story begin. Description: The MOVING reference member state of this VC is TURKEY. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 05 TR. Approximately 4517 tons of grapes were produced in Elmal in 2020. 45% of the grape production in Elmal is fresh table grape; 40% wine grape and 15% dried grape. There are two main marketing channels used by grape growers. The grape growers have problems in marketing fresh table grapes. The growers prefer to sell directly to consumers in order to get a high price for fresh table grapes. The growers sell wine grapes to wine companies. The problem in the grape value chain can be seen in the marketing of fresh grapes. One of the negative aspects of the value chain is that the grapes produced are supplied to the market without being processed. Also; it is observed that the grape growers in Elmal do not have a farmer organization. On the other hand; the fact that the grape grown in the region is a quality and special variety is an important opportunity to improve the value chain.,439,bed; year; value chain; table grape; reference; number; mountain; population density; problem; government; productivity; majority; antalya; hand; innovation; town; switzerland; gross value added; grape; requirement; employment; community; marketing; turkey; antalya province; per capita income; time; wine,36.0,39.0
